# UML Calculator (Community Edition)

A recursive symbolic calculator implementing the **Universal Mathematical Language (UML)** and **Recursive Integration System (RIS)** — blending traditional mathematics, symbolic logic, and experimental AI-ready syntax.

This version is focused on accessibility, visual clarity, and educational use, while preserving the architecture necessary for full symbolic computation and future cognitive integration.

## ✨ Features

**This Community Edition includes:**

- 🧮 Standard mathematical operations and expression parsing
- 📐 Recursive Integration System (RIS) operations (simplified version)
- 📊 Basic function plotting and equation solving
- 🎨 Terminal-based UI with theme support
- 📋 Calculation history with optional export
- 🧠 Basic UML diagram generation to visualize symbolic math structures

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Nemeca99/UML_RIS_Demo.git
cd UML_RIS_Demo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

⚡ Quick Start

# Start the CLI calculator
python calculator.py

# On Windows:
run_calculator.bat

🧪 Example Usage

# Evaluate a standard math expression
python calculator.py calc "2 + 3*5"

# Perform a RIS operation
python calculator.py ris_calc 6 3

# Plot a function
python calculator.py plot "x^2 + 2*x - 3" -10,10

# Solve an equation
python calculator.py solve "x^2 - 4 = 0"

# Generate a UML diagram
python calculator.py uml rules

🔍 Output Examples
➕ Standard Calculation

>>> calc "3*x^2 - 5*x + 2"
Expression: 3*x^2 - 5*x + 2
Result: 24.0

♻️ RIS Meta-Operator

>>> ris_calc 6 3
RIS Operation: RIS(6, 3)
Result: 18

Explanation:
a > 1 and b > 1 → RIS applies multiplication: 6 × 3 = 18

🧱 UML Diagram

The calculator can generate simple UML diagrams representing mathematical operations.
