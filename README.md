# UML Calculator (Community Edition)

A modern calculator that combines standard mathematics with UML diagram generation capabilities, designed for both practical calculations and visualizing mathematical concepts.

## Features

**This Community Edition includes:**

- üßÆ Standard mathematical operations and equation solving
- üìä Basic function plotting with nice visualization
- üìê Simplified Recursive Integration System (RIS) operations
- üìà Terminal-based user interface with rich formatting
- üìã Calculation history with export capabilities
- üé® Multiple UI themes
- üìù Basic UML diagram generation for mathematical concepts

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uml-calculator.git
cd uml-calculator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the interactive calculator
python calculator.py

# Or on Windows, simply use:
run_calculator.bat
```

### Direct Command Examples

```bash
# Evaluate a mathematical expression
python calculator.py calc "2 + 3*5"

# Perform an RIS calculation
python calculator.py ris_calc 6 3

# Plot a function
python calculator.py plot "x^2 + 2*x - 3" -10,10

# Solve an equation
python calculator.py solve "x^2 - 4 = 0"

# Generate a simple UML diagram
python calculator.py uml rules
```

## Example Outputs

### Standard Calculations

```
>>> calc "3*x^2 - 5*x + 2"
Expression: 3*x^2 - 5*x + 2
Result: 24.0
```

### RIS Operations

```
>>> ris_calc 6 3
RIS Operation: RIS(6, 3)
Result: 2

Explanation:
When a is divisible by b, RIS performs Division: 6 √∑ 3 = 2

Note: This is a simplified version. The Enterprise Edition includes the complete 
Recursive Integration System with advanced mathematical foundations.
```

### UML Diagrams

The calculator can generate UML diagrams to visualize mathematical operations:
